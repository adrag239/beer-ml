ML.NET playground

This demo project uses Systembolaget (government owned chain of liquor stores in Sweden) database to perform 4 types of Machine Learning using ML.NET framework (1.1 version):
- Binary Classification: predict if liquor is beer by it's name
- Multi-Class Classification: predict type of liquor by it's name
- Regression: predict price of liquor by it's name, type, volume and country of origin
- Clustering: cluster liquors names into two clusters: champagne and whisky
